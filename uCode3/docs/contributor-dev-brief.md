# uHomeNest — contributor workflow (optional @dev / #binder parity)

*Former filename:* `uHOME-server-dev-brief.md`.

**Scope (2026-03):** uHOME is **not** a uDOS **Workspace / binder-compile** product. Operators and public planning use **`docs/ROADMAP-V4.md`** (v4 plan), **`docs/thin-ui-feature-completion.md`**, issues, and family round notes (`uDOS-dev`). **Thin browser surfaces** are **server-rendered Markdown + Tailwind Typography (`prose`)** only — no binder-backed doc shell, no Wizard workspace dependency.

**Sync records:** fields such as `binder_project` / `binders` in `sync_records` stay as **optional JSON compatibility** for **`integrated-udos`** clients sharing family envelope shapes. That is **not** “uHOME ships binder UX.”

The material below describes **optional** alignment if a contributor already uses the uDOS **`@dev`** tree and **#binder** language. Treat it as **reference**, not a requirement for uHOME-only or standalone-household work.

⸻

Purpose

The uHomeNest monorepo should:
	•	keep a clear split between local experiments and what ships in the public tree
	•	use **roadmap + checklists + issues** as the default planning spine
	•	allow local development scaffolding in private or `@dev` extension layers where useful
	•	prevent dev-mode artifacts from leaking into the distributable repo
	•	restrict public repo contributions to approved contributors only

Optional uDOS-style habits (below) may still be used when coordinating with the wider family; they are **not** the authoritative uHOME process.

⸻

Optional alignment with uDOS core (reference)

Some contributors mirror uDOS habits:

	•	`@dev` workspace = optional active development environment
	•	`#binder` = optional mission/milestone container **in uDOS-dev workflows**
	•	local extension supports scaffolding and background advancement
	•	review before promoting large changes into the public server repo

This does **not** imply uHomeNest commits are binder-gated or that operators ever see binder semantics in product UI.

⸻

## Optional shared lifecycle (when using #binders)

If you **choose** to track work with `#binders`, you may mirror the uDOS core lifecycle language below. **Skip this section** if you use issues + roadmap only.

Open
Hand off
Advance
Review
Commit
Complete
Compile
Promote

Meaning

Open
Define a new objective or development mission.

Hand off
Prepare the binder so it can be progressed locally.

Advance
Perform bounded development progress inside the @dev workspace.

Review
Evaluate results, identify risks, and check milestone alignment.

Commit
Checkpoint progress locally.

Complete
Objective outcome has been achieved.

Compile
Clean development artifacts and prepare a final binder outcome.

Promote
Approved contributors selectively move outputs into the distributable repo.

Important rule:

local completion does not imply repo contribution.

uHomeNest (legacy uHOME-server naming) inside @dev (**historical — uDOS workspace**)

**uHomeNest (2026-04+):** use repo-root **`TASKS.md`**, **`.local/`**, and **`.compost/`** (UDN). Tracked **`@dev/`** binder trees were **removed** from this monorepo in favour of **v4** entry points in [`ROADMAP-V4.md`](ROADMAP-V4.md) and [`architecture/UHOME-SERVER-DEV-PLAN.md`](architecture/UHOME-SERVER-DEV-PLAN.md).

The uHomeNest project should have a defined space inside the shared development workspace.

Example conceptual structure:

@dev/
  uhome-server/
    workspace/
    binders/
    local-extension/
    review/
    compost/

This allows uHomeNest development to remain consistent with uDOS core workflow patterns.

⸻

Recommended @dev sections

workspace/

Active development notes, scratch work, experiments, and temporary tasks.

binders/

All development missions, milestones, fixes, and feature streams.

local-extension/

Local tools, automation helpers, prototypes, dev utilities, adapters, and unpublished scaffolding.

review/

Artifacts awaiting review or approval before repo promotion.

compost/

Deprecated experiments, stale drafts, or abandoned exploratory work.

⸻

## Optional: #binder usage (uDOS-family parity only)

If you already work in the uDOS `@dev` lane, you **may** track missions with `#binders`. **Do not** treat this as mandatory for uHomeNest: use GitHub issues and `docs/ROADMAP-V4.md` / `docs/thin-ui-feature-completion.md` first.

Where used, binders may represent:
	•	milestones
	•	feature work
	•	infrastructure updates
	•	server configuration improvements
	•	integration work
	•	migration tasks
	•	documentation revisions
	•	packaging and release preparation

Example binders

#binder/uhome-server-local-network-runtime
#binder/uhome-server-auth-layer
#binder/uhome-server-api-routing
#binder/uhome-server-device-integration
#binder/uhome-server-installation-flow
#binder/uhome-server-release-prep-v1


⸻

Binder role in server development

Each binder should document:
	•	the mission objective
	•	associated milestone
	•	current state
	•	development tasks
	•	blockers or dependencies
	•	areas of the codebase affected
	•	local development artifacts
	•	potential promotion candidates
	•	compile and completion criteria

This ensures server development progress is structured and inspectable.

⸻

Advancing pending development tasks

Pending uHomeNest development should be progressed within the @dev workspace.

Advancement should:
	•	occur locally first
	•	follow binder mission boundaries
	•	advance incrementally
	•	maintain milestone alignment
	•	avoid uncontrolled mutation of the public repo
	•	produce reviewable outcomes

Development should therefore follow this flow:

@dev workspace
    ↓
binder advancement
    ↓
review
    ↓
compile
    ↓
promotion
    ↓
public repo


⸻

Milestones and objectives

uHomeNest development should organize work into milestones and objectives.

Milestones

Major development checkpoints such as:
	•	server runtime stabilization
	•	local network service architecture
	•	device integration support
	•	authentication layer
	•	API routing normalization
	•	installer and deployment tooling
	•	release preparation

Objectives

Specific outcomes that contribute to a milestone.

Examples:
	•	configure local network service layer
	•	implement device discovery
	•	normalize API endpoint routing
	•	add configuration loader
	•	implement authentication gateway
	•	finalize installation documentation

Binders

Execution containers for objectives.

Hierarchy example:

Milestone
  -> Objective
    -> #binder

or

Milestone
  -> #binder

for larger development streams.

⸻

Local extension model

uHomeNest development requires a local extension layer that supports experimentation and development tooling.

This layer should remain outside the distributable repo.

Purpose of local extension

Local extension may contain:
	•	experimental server modules
	•	local configuration scaffolds
	•	development utilities
	•	automation helpers
	•	binder runtime state
	•	test harnesses
	•	temporary scripts
	•	review staging artifacts
	•	experimental integrations

Principle:

local extension is flexible and experimental; the distributable repo is curated and stable.

⸻

Contribution boundary

The uHomeNest monorepo must enforce a clear contribution boundary.

Rule

Only approved contributors may promote changes into the distributable repo.

This ensures:
	•	development scaffolding remains local
	•	experimental code does not pollute the repo
	•	architectural stability is preserved
	•	release surfaces remain clean

⸻

Promotion workflow

Promotion should follow a structured process.

local @dev workspace
    ↓
binder compile
    ↓
review
    ↓
approval
    ↓
contributor promotion
    ↓
distributable repo

This ensures that the repo reflects intentional, curated development outcomes.

⸻

Gitignore scaffold for local development

The uHomeNest monorepo should include gitignore patterns that exclude local development artifacts.

Example categories

# uDOS dev workspace
.dev/
@dev/
binders/
.local-extension/
.local/
.compost/
review-staging/
workspace-state/

# Local notes and drafts
*.local.md
*.draft.md
*.scratch.md
*.temp.md

# Machine-specific configuration
.env.local
.env.dev.local
*.machine.json
*.local.json
*.cache.json

# Binder runtime state
binder-state/
binder-cache/
binder-runs/
workflow-state/
workflow-cache/

# Review and compile staging
compile-staging/
promotion-staging/
approval-staging/

# Editor/system files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
.vscode/
.idea/

This prevents development artifacts from entering the repo unintentionally.

⸻

Recommended uHomeNest workflow

1. Open a binder

Create a binder representing the development objective.

Example:

#binder/uhome-server-api-routing
#binder/uhome-server-device-discovery
#binder/uhome-server-installation-flow


⸻

2. Work inside @dev

All experimentation, notes, and development should occur within the historical uHOME-server area of the @dev workspace.

⸻

3. Advance development

Progress binders incrementally while maintaining milestone alignment.

⸻

4. Review candidate outcomes

Inspect which outputs should remain local and which may be promotable.

⸻

5. Compile the binder

Compile should:
	•	remove development clutter
	•	normalize documentation and scripts
	•	isolate promotable outputs
	•	archive stale materials

⸻

6. Promote approved outputs

An approved contributor moves selected outcomes into the distributable repo.

⸻

Binder metadata for uHomeNest

Example binder metadata:

binder: uhome-server-device-discovery
project: uhome-server
milestone: device-integration-v1
objective: implement local device discovery service
status: active
priority: high
mode: slow-and-low
repo_target: uhome-server
local_only: true
promotion_candidate: partial
approved_contributor_required: true
compile_target: review-ready

Additional optional fields:

files_touched:
repo_paths:
local_paths:
blockers:
review_required: true
promotion_notes:
completion_criteria:


⸻

Compile and promotion behavior

For uHomeNest, compile prepares a binder outcome for review and possible promotion.

Compile should:
	•	clean dev artifacts
	•	consolidate documentation
	•	isolate repo-ready outputs
	•	archive exploratory material
	•	produce a promotion summary

Promotion then moves approved artifacts only into the repo.

⸻

Governance rule

uHomeNest should follow the same governance philosophy as uDOS core.

The @dev workspace is the active mission development surface, #binders track development progress and objectives, local extension supports experimental work, and the distributable repo remains a curated output surface governed by approved contributors.

⸻

Short policy block for repo documentation

You may include the following summary directly in the repo documentation.

uHomeNest development follows the same @dev workspace and binder-driven workflow used by the uDOS core repo. Development objectives, milestones, and pending work are tracked as #binders within the historical uHOME-server area of the @dev workspace. Local extension scaffolding supports active development while remaining excluded from the distributable repo through gitignore and workspace separation. Contribution to the public uHomeNest monorepo is restricted to approved contributors, with changes promoted only after binder compile, review, and approval.

⸻

Suggested command pattern

Example command workflow:

binder open #uhome-server-device-discovery
binder handoff #uhome-server-device-discovery
binder advance #uhome-server-device-discovery
binder review #uhome-server-device-discovery
binder compile #uhome-server-device-discovery
binder promote #uhome-server-device-discovery


⸻

Final intent

The uHomeNest monorepo should remain:
	•	developed locally within @dev
	•	organized through #binders
	•	structured by milestones and objectives
	•	supported by a flexible local extension layer
	•	promoted into the distributable repo only through approved contributor governance

This keeps uHomeNest aligned with the uDOS development model while maintaining a clean and stable public repo.
