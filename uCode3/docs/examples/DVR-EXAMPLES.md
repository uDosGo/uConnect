This document provides practical examples and test scenarios for using the uHomeNest DVR system.

## Overview

The examples demonstrate how to create, manage, and test different types of DVR rules using the API endpoints.

## Prerequisites

- uHomeNest server running
- API accessible at `http://localhost:8000/api/dvr/`

    "start_time": "2024-04-18T18:30:00",
    "end_time": "2024-04-18T19:00:00",
    "program_title": "Evening News",
    "quality_profile": "hd",
    "priority": 1
  }'
```

**Expected Response**:
```json
{
  "rule_id": "rule_1",
  "rule_name": "Nightly News",
  "rule_type": "time-based",

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Rule Lifecycle

**Objective**: Test creating, updating, disabling, and deleting a rule

**Steps**:
1. Create a time-based rule
2. Verify rule appears in list
3. Update the rule (change priority)
4. Disable the rule
5. Re-enable the rule
6. Delete the rule

**Commands**:
```bash
# 1. Create rule
CREATE_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/dvr/rules/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "rule_name": "Test Rule",
    "rule_type": "time-based",
    "channel_id": "test-channel",
    "start_time": "2024-04-19T14:00:00",
    "end_time": "2024-04-19T15:00:00",
    "quality_profile": "hd",
    "priority": 3
  }')

RULE_ID=$(echo $CREATE_RESPONSE | jq -r '.rule_id')
echo "Created rule: $RULE_ID"

# 2. Verify rule in list
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/dvr/rules/ | jq ".rules[] | select(.rule_id == \"$RULE_ID\")"

# 3. Update rule
curl -s -X PUT http://localhost:8000/api/dvr/rules/$RULE_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"priority": 2}'

# 4. Disable rule
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/dvr/rules/$RULE_ID/disable

# 5. Re-enable rule
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/dvr/rules/$RULE_ID/enable

# 6. Delete rule
curl -s -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/dvr/rules/$RULE_ID
```

**Expected Results**:
- Each step should return success: true
- Rule should appear/disappear from lists appropriately
- Priority should change from 3 to 2

### Scenario 2: Conflict Resolution

**Objective**: Test automatic conflict resolution

**Steps**:
1. Create two overlapping time-based rules
2. Check schedule for conflicts
3. Resolve conflict using priority
4. Verify only higher priority rule remains scheduled

**Commands**:
```bash
# 1. Create first rule (high priority)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/dvr/rules/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "rule_name": "High Priority Show",
    "rule_type": "time-based",
    "channel_id": "entertainment",
    "start_time": "2024-04-19T20:00:00",
    "end_time": "2024-04-19T21:00:00",
    "quality_profile": "hd",
    "priority": 1
  }'

# 2. Create second rule (low priority, same time)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/dvr/rules/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "rule_name": "Low Priority Show",
    "rule_type": "time-based",
    "channel_id": "entertainment",
    "start_time": "2024-04-19T20:00:00",
    "end_time": "2024-04-19T21:00:00",
    "quality_profile": "hd",
    "priority": 5
  }'

# 3. Check for conflicts
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/dvr/schedule/conflicts

# 4. Refresh schedule to resolve conflicts
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/dvr/schedule/refresh

# 5. Verify only high priority rule is scheduled
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/dvr/recordings/upcoming
```

**Expected Results**:
- Conflict should be detected between the two rules
- After refresh, only the high priority rule should remain scheduled
- Low priority rule should be marked as conflicted or not scheduled

### Scenario 3: Recording Lifecycle

**Objective**: Test the complete recording lifecycle

**Steps**:
1. Create a time-based rule for immediate recording
2. Check upcoming recordings
3. Wait for recording to complete (or simulate)
4. Check recent recordings
5. Get recording details
6. Cancel/delete the recording

**Commands**:
```bash
# 1. Create rule for immediate recording (use current time + 5 minutes)
NOW=$(date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:00Z")
START_TIME=$(date -u -d "$NOW + 5 minutes" +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:00Z")
END_TIME=$(date -u -d "$NOW + 35 minutes" +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:00Z")

curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/dvr/rules/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"rule_name\": \"Immediate Test Recording\",
    \"rule_type\": \"time-based\",
    \"channel_id\": \"test-channel\",
    \"start_time\": \"$START_TIME\",
    \"end_time\": \"$END_TIME\",
    \"quality_profile\": \"hd\",
    \"priority\": 2
  }"

# 2. Check upcoming recordings
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/dvr/recordings/upcoming

# 3. Wait for recording to complete (in real scenario, wait 30+ minutes)
# For testing, we'll just check the recent recordings
sleep 10

# 4. Check recent recordings
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/dvr/recordings/recent

# 5. Get recording stats
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/dvr/recordings/stats

# 6. Clean up - delete the rule
# (In real scenario, you might also delete the recording)
```

**Expected Results**:
- Recording should appear in upcoming list
- After completion, should move to recent recordings
- Recording stats should show completed count increased

### Scenario 4: Job Queue Integration

**Objective**: Test job queue integration with DVR rules

**Steps**:
1. Create a time-based rule
2. Check job queue status
3. Verify recording job was created
4. Monitor job progress
5. Complete the recording
6. Verify job status updated

**Commands**:
```bash
# 1. Create time-based rule
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/dvr/rules/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "rule_name": "Job Queue Test",
    "rule_type": "time-based",
    "channel_id": "news-hd",
    "start_time": "2024-04-19T15:00:00",
    "end_time": "2024-04-19T16:00:00",
    "quality_profile": "hd",
    "priority": 3
  }'

# 2. Check job queue status
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/runtime/thin/automation/jobs

# 3. Get detailed job queue info
JOB_QUEUE_STATUS=$(curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/dvr/schedule/status)
echo $JOB_QUEUE_STATUS | jq .

# 4. Check automation dashboard for job monitoring
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/runtime/thin/automation/

# 5. After recording completes, check job status again
# (In real scenario, wait until after the recording time)
sleep 60

# 6. Verify job completed
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/runtime/thin/automation/jobs
```

**Expected Results**:
- Recording job should appear in job queue
- Job status should change from queued → running → completed
- Automation dashboard should show job progress
- Schedule status should reflect completed recording

  }
]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: Rule not appearing in list**
- Check API response for errors
- Verify rule_id is valid
- Check if rule was accidentally deleted

**Issue: Recording not starting**
- Verify rule is enabled
- Check channel availability
- Verify tuner is available
- Check disk space

**Issue: Conflict not resolved**
- Check priority settings
- Verify conflict resolution strategy
- Manually resolve if needed

**Issue: API returns 404**
- Verify API endpoint URL
- Check server is running
- Verify route is properly registered

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check server status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health

# Check DVR status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/dvr/schedule/status

# Check job queue
curl http://localhost:8000/api/runtime/thin/automation/jobs

# View server logs
tail -f ~/.udos/logs/uhome-server.log

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status uhome-server
```

## Best Practices

### Rule Management

1. **Use descriptive names**: "Nightly News" instead of "Rule 1"
2. **Set appropriate priorities**: High for important shows, low for optional
3. **Use keep_until dates**: Automatically clean up old recordings
4. **Avoid duplicates**: Enable avoid_duplicates for series rules
5. **Test rules**: Use test-recording endpoint before creating permanent rules

### Performance Optimization

1. **Limit concurrent recordings**: Based on tuner availability
2. **Balance quality vs storage**: Use appropriate quality profiles
3. **Regular cleanup**: Delete old recordings automatically
4. **Monitor disk space**: Set up alerts for low disk space
5. **Schedule during off-peak**: Reduce load on system resources

### Monitoring

1. **Check schedule regularly**: Verify upcoming recordings
2. **Monitor job queue**: Watch for stuck or failed jobs
3. **Review conflicts**: Resolve scheduling conflicts promptly
4. **Track storage usage**: Prevent disk full situations
5. **Review logs**: Identify and fix recurring issues
