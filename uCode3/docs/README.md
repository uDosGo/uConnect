## Consolidated map (uHomeNest)

| Topic | Where |
| --- | --- |
| **Product version** | **uHomeNest v3.9** — repo root [`../VERSION`](../VERSION) (**3.9.x**); changelog [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) |
| **v4 plan (canonical)** | [`ROADMAP-V4.md`](ROADMAP-V4.md) · [`UHOME-DEV-ROADMAP.md`](UHOME-DEV-ROADMAP.md) redirects here |
| **Monorepo** | [`MONOREPO.md`](MONOREPO.md) |
| **Universal dev + USXD** | [`../dev/UNIVERSAL-DEV.md`](../dev/UNIVERSAL-DEV.md) |
| **Retiring old files locally** | [`../dev/COMPOST-LEGACY.md`](../dev/COMPOST-LEGACY.md) |
| **USXD uHOME surfaces (interchange)** | Sibling repo [`UniversalSurfaceXD/docs/uhome/README.md`](https://github.com/fredporter/UniversalSurfaceXD/blob/main/docs/uhome/README.md) |

---

`docs/` is the **stable reference** lane for the **uHomeNest** monorepo (**v3.9.x**) and **uHOME** product docs, aligned with the
uDOS family split:

| Lane | Location | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reference | [`docs/`](README.md) (here) | Architecture, clients, ops, specs |
| Wiki | [`../wiki/`](../wiki/README.md) | Short units and quick orientation |
| Learning | [`../learning/`](../learning/README.md) | Study order, courses pointers, uDOS Library links |

Tutorial and student-facing step-through material also lives under
[`courses/`](../courses/README.md) (repo root) with maintainer notes in
`docs/courses/`. This tree is for architecture, pathway, client, operational,
and implementation documentation tied to the real repo.

## Entry Points

### Use

- [../QUICKSTART.md](../QUICKSTART.md) for the fastest local run path
- [../FIRST-TIME-INSTALL.md](../FIRST-TIME-INSTALL.md) for clean-machine setup
- [USE.md](pathway/USE.md) for the current operator path
- [UHOME-DASHBOARD.md](ui/UHOME-DASHBOARD.md) for the dashboard surface
- [BEACON-ACTIVATE.md](clients/BEACON-ACTIVATE.md)
  for local portal and vault-reader positioning
- [SONIC-STANDALONE-RELEASE-AND-INSTALL.md](howto/SONIC-STANDALONE-RELEASE-AND-INSTALL.md)
  for release and install guidance

### Learn

- [README.md](pathway/README.md) in `docs/pathway/` for repo positioning
- [education-dev-brief.md](education-dev-brief.md)
  for the local pathway brief
- [UHOME-v1.5.md](specs/UHOME-v1.5.md) for the current canonical spec

### Build (v4)

- [UHOME-SERVER-DEV-PLAN.md](architecture/UHOME-SERVER-DEV-PLAN.md) — **v4** dev entry (roadmaps + thin UI + USXD handoff)
- [contributor-dev-brief.md](contributor-dev-brief.md) — contributor workflow (optional `#binder` parity)
- [thin-ui-feature-completion.md](thin-ui-feature-completion.md) — thin UI and product checklists
- [education-dev-brief.md](education-dev-brief.md) — education-structure brief
- [pathway/BUILD.md](pathway/BUILD.md) — extend the runtime (v4 path)
- [REPO-FAMILY.md](pathway/REPO-FAMILY.md) — family-boundary and companion-repo rules
- The deprecated `uhome_server.sonic` namespace is compatibility-only; new work should use `uhome_server.installer`

## Family library (GitHub Pages)

The **uDOS Library** indexes uHOME repos (Docs / Wiki / Learning links) from
[`uDOS-docs` `site/data/family-source.json`](https://github.com/fredporter/uDOS-docs/blob/main/site/data/family-source.json).
The public **Learning hub** is `https://fredporter.github.io/uDOS-docs/learning.html`
when Pages is deployed.
