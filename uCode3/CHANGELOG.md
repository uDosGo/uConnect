The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**Product line:** the monorepo release is tracked in the repo-root **`VERSION`** file (uHomeNest **3.9.x**). The installable Python package **`uhome-server`** keeps its own version in `pyproject.toml`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- **Naming:** completed **uHomeNest v3.9** positioning across README, `docs/MONOREPO.md`, pathway docs, wiki, scripts/learning READMEs, integration guide paths, `pyproject.toml` descriptions, and contributor briefs. **Wire / JSON** `policy_owner` values such as `uHOME-server` are unchanged (see MONOREPO naming table).

## [3.9.2] — 2026-04-10

### Changed

- **Planning:** consolidated the **v4** product plan into a single canonical **[`docs/ROADMAP-V4.md`](docs/ROADMAP-V4.md)**. **[`docs/UHOME-DEV-ROADMAP.md`](docs/UHOME-DEV-ROADMAP.md)** is now a short redirect for bookmarks; cross-links and module docstrings updated.

## [3.9.1] — 2026-04-10

### Removed

- Retired pre-v4 **phase milestone** docs (`docs/architecture/PHASE-*.md` and `server/docs/` mirrors), **migration / roadmap status** snapshots, tracked **`@dev/`** binder trees (root, `server/`, `matter/`, `host/`), duplicate **`dev/archive-uHOME-app-*.md`** and **`server/dev/`** copies, root **`structure-uhome.txt`**, and unused root **`uhome/`** FastAPI scaffold. Optional local copies under **`.compost/cleanup-2026-04-10/`** (see [`dev/COMPOST-LEGACY.md`](dev/COMPOST-LEGACY.md)).

### Changed

- **`docs/architecture/UHOME-SERVER-DEV-PLAN.md`** and **`server/docs/`** mirror — slim **v4** dev entry only; [`docs/pathway/BUILD.md`](docs/pathway/BUILD.md) and doc indexes updated to match.

## [3.9.0] — 2026-04-10

Monorepo **uHomeNest** product release **3.9.0**: canonical **`VERSION`**, consolidated universal-dev and v4 roadmap docs, USXD interchange scaffold for uHOME thin/kiosk handoff, and compost guidance for legacy material.

### Added
- Root **`VERSION`** file (**3.9.0**).
- **`dev/UNIVERSAL-DEV.md`** — UDN map for uHomeNest + UniversalSurfaceXD, workspace files, commands.
- **`dev/COMPOST-LEGACY.md`** — when and how to use **`.compost/`** for superseded local copies.
- **`docs/ROADMAP-V4.md`** — uHOME v4 narrative vs USXD v4 lab line (cross-links).
- `docs/thin-ui-feature-completion.md` — living checklist for thin UI lanes and product backlog.
- Thin **Tailwind Typography** bundle (`static/thin/prose.css`, built from `thin-prose-build/`)
  and HTML surfaces: `GET /api/runtime/thin/read` (default markdown intro), `GET /api/runtime/thin/browse`
  (markdown under `docs/` via `rel=` query), cross-links with `/api/runtime/thin/automation`.
- **`markdown`** dependency for server-side markdown rendering in thin read/browse mode.
- `uhome migrate wizard-to-kiosk`: copies `memory/wizard/uhome/presentation.json` to
  `memory/kiosk/uhome/`, rewrites `wizard_mode_active` → `kiosk_local_session` in that
  JSON, and updates `library/**/container.json` (`wizard_only` → `thin_kiosk_only`,
  `callable_from` `wizard` → `thin-kiosk`). Flags: `--dry-run`, `--force`,
  `--remove-legacy`, `--skip-presentation`, `--skip-manifests`.
- Bundled household network policy contract + schema in `src/uhome_server/contracts/`
  with a default **`lan`** profile for regular home/office LANs (no `uDOS-wizard` checkout)
- `GET /api/runtime/contracts/uhome-network-policy/schema`
- Health and readiness endpoints (`/api/health`, `/api/ready`, `/api/debug/registries`)
- Backup and restore CLI commands (`uhome backup create`, `uhome backup restore`, `uhome backup list`)
- Shared sync-record contract inspection and envelope validation commands (`uhome contracts ...`)
- Runtime sync-record ingest and retrieval endpoints backed by file-based envelope storage
- Sync-envelope ingest supports standard family sync-record envelopes
- Comprehensive operational runbooks (6 guides covering storage, nodes, registries, degradation)
- Deployment Guide for Ubuntu 20.04+ LTS systems
- Post-install validation script for automated deployment verification
- Docker Compose production template with health checks and resource limits
- Observability guide with monitoring, alerting, and capacity planning
- Operations README as central navigation hub for all operational documentation

### Changed
- **Planning:** uHOME **does not** ship uDOS **#binder / Workspace** as operator UX;
  thin surfaces stay **Markdown + Tailwind Prose** (`docs/contributor-dev-brief.md`,
  `docs/UHOME-DEV-ROADMAP.md`). **`sync_records`** `binder_*` fields remain for optional
  **`integrated-udos`** JSON only (`sync_records` module docstring).
- **`QUICKSTART.md`:** thin UI URLs and default **`8000`** port called out for browser proof.
- **Code decoupling:** sync-record contract + schema ship under `uhome_server/contracts/`
  (no `uDOS-core` path); optional overrides `UHOME_SYNC_RECORD_CONTRACT_PATH` /
  `UHOME_SYNC_RECORD_SCHEMA_PATH`. Removed `get_udos_family_root` from server config.
- Network policy validation module renamed to `uhome_network_policy.py` (replaces
  `wizard_policy.py`). Workflow/automation contract metadata points at
  `uhome_server/contracts/*.json` identifiers; default automation `origin_surface` is
  `uHOME-kiosk`. Launcher state is written under `memory/kiosk/uhome/` (still reads
  legacy `memory/wizard/uhome/` if present). JSON config accepts `legacy-uhome.json`
  before `wizard.json`.
- **uHOME-client:** bundled `src/runtime-services.json`; profiles are standalone with
  `shell_adapter` `thin-kiosk`; optional orchestration via   `UH_EXTERNAL_ORCHESTRATION_CONTRACT_PATH`
  and transport `orchestration-assisted` only. Family root: prefer `UHOME_FAMILY_ROOT`,
  with legacy fallback `UDOS_UHOME_FAMILY_ROOT`.
- Library catalog: `wrapper_route` field, `thin-kiosk` / `thin_kiosk_only` terminology
  (still accepts legacy `wizard` / `wizard_only` in manifests).
- Product docs (`README`, `docs/architecture.md`, `base-runtime-boundary.md`,
  `uHOME-spec.md`, pathway `REPO-FAMILY.md`) reposition **uHOME** as a standalone
  media + controller-first kiosk + decentralised LAN + dual-boot (Sonic) +
  curated library + HA-via-thin-UX product—not a sub-part of uDOS; **`uHOME-matter`**
  README aligned for kiosk-visible automation
- Network policy loads from the uHOME package bundle; `policy_owner` payloads use
  `uHOME-server`. `/api/runtime/contracts/uhome-network-policy` includes `routes`,
  `deployment`, and `future_integration` metadata (replaces `wizard_routes` on that payload).
- `/api/runtime/contracts/workflow-automation`: `workflow_owner` is `uHOME-server` for the
  standalone stream; `integration_note` mentions optional future **uDOS-ubuntu** coordination.
- Improved backup timestamp resolution to include microseconds (prevents filename conflicts)

### Deprecated
- None

### Removed
- Coupling to `uDOS-empire` for runtime info and related docs/templates

### Fixed
- None

### Security
- None
