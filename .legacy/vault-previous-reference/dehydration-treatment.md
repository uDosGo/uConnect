# Dehydration Treatment & Prevention

**Category:** Medical - Essential Knowledge
**Priority:** HIGH - Very common, potentially serious
**Season:** Year-round risk, especially hot months
**Difficulty:** Easy to prevent, easy to treat if caught early

---

## Overview

Dehydration occurs when your body loses more fluid than you take in. In hot, dry climates this can happen surprisingly fast.

**Severity levels:**
1. **Mild** (2-5% body water loss) - Easily fixed
2. **Moderate** (5-10% loss) - Needs attention
3. **Severe** (> 10% loss) - Medical emergency

### Dehydration Assessment Flowchart

## Treatment

### Mild to Moderate Dehydration

**Rehydration protocol:**

1. **Stop activity**
   - Rest in cool, shaded area
   - Remove excess clothing

2. **Drink fluids gradually**
   ```
   First hour:
   ├─ 250ml every 15 minutes
   ├─ Sip slowly (don't chug)
   └─ Total: ~1 litre first hour

   Next 2-3 hours:
   ├─ 125-250ml every 15-30 minutes
   └─ Continue until urine pale yellow
   ```

3. **What to drink:**

   **Best options:**
   - Water (most situations)
   - Electrolyte drinks (diluted 50/50 with water)
   - Homemade rehydration solution (recipe below)
   - Coconut water (natural electrolytes)

   **Avoid:**
   - Alcohol (dehydrates further)
   - Caffeine (mild diuretic)
   - Sugary soft drinks (can worsen)
   - Very cold drinks (can cause cramping)

4. **Monitor progress:**
   - Check urine color every urination
   - Symptoms should improve in 1-2 hours
   - If not improving or worsening → medical help

### Severe Dehydration

**CALL 000 - This is an emergency**

While waiting:
- Lay person down, elevate legs slightly
- Keep cool (but not cold)
- Small sips of water if conscious and able
- No food
- Monitor breathing
- Be ready for CPR if needed

**DO NOT:**
- Force fluids if unconscious
- Give alcohol
- Leave person alone

---

## Homemade Rehydration Solution

**WHO-recommended recipe:**

```
Ingredients:
├─ 1 litre clean water
├─ 6 level teaspoons sugar
└─ ½ level teaspoon salt

Mix thoroughly.
```

**Why it works:**
- Sugar helps intestines absorb water faster
- Salt replaces lost electrolytes (sodium)
- Better absorption than plain water

**Variations:**
- Add squeeze of lemon/lime (vitamin C, flavor)
- Use honey instead of sugar (same amount)

**Storage:** Use within 24 hours, refrigerate if possible

╚═══════════════════╩═══════════════════════╝
```

**Factors increasing needs:**
- High temperature
- Low humidity (dry air)
- High altitude
- Fever, illness
- Diarrhea, vomiting
- Sweating heavily
- Physical activity

### Hydration Schedule

**Don't wait for thirst - drink proactively:**

```
Daily routine:
06:00  ███ 250ml upon waking
07:00  ███ 250ml with breakfast
10:00  ███ 250ml morning break
12:00  ███ 250ml with lunch
15:00  ███ 250ml afternoon break
18:00  ███ 250ml with dinner
20:00  ███ 250ml evening
       ───
Total: 1.75L minimum
+ more with meals and activity
```

**During activity:**
- **Before:** 250-500ml in the hour before
- **During:** 125-250ml every 15-20 minutes
- **After:** 500ml-1L to replace losses

---

## Special Situations

### Hot Weather Work

**Hydration strategy:**

```
Work schedule:
├─ Pre-hydrate: 500ml before starting
├─ During work: 250ml every 15-30 min
├─ Breaks: Drink even if not thirsty
├─ Post-work: 500ml-1L to recover
└─ Monitor urine color continuously
```

**Warning signs to stop:**
- Stopped urinating
- Very dark urine
- Dizziness, confusion
- Stopped sweating
- Muscle cramps

### Travel/Bush

**Challenges:**
- Water may be limited
- Harder to monitor intake
- More physical exertion
- Environmental exposure

**Solutions:**
- Calculate needs before trip (add 50% buffer)
- Carry extra water
- Know water source locations
- Ration if limited (but drink enough)
- Avoid activity in peak heat

**Minimum for survival:**
- 2L per day in shade, no activity
- 4L+ per day if moving/working
- More in hot, dry conditions

### Illness (diarrhea/vomiting)

**Rapid dehydration risk:**

```
Rehydration protocol:
├─ Small, frequent sips (every 5-10 min)
├─ Use rehydration solution (not just water)
├─ Continue even if vomiting (some absorbs)
├─ Avoid solid food until improving
└─ Seek medical help if:
    ├─ Can't keep any fluids down
    ├─ Diarrhea/vomiting > 24 hours
    ├─ Blood in stool/vomit
    └─ Signs of severe dehydration
```

### Children

**Higher risk:**
- Smaller bodies (dehydrate faster)
- May not recognize/communicate thirst
- More active (generate heat)
- Larger surface area to weight ratio

**Prevention:**
- Offer water every 15-30 minutes
- Don't rely on them asking
- Watch for reduced play, fussiness
- Monitor wet nappies/toilet frequency

**Signs in children:**
- Crying without tears
- Dry mouth, tongue
- Sunken fontanelle (babies)
- No wet nappy for 3+ hours
- Listless, lethargic

### Elderly

**Higher risk:**
- Reduced thirst sensation
- Medications (diuretics)
- Mobility issues (can't get water easily)
- Kidney function changes

**Prevention:**
- Scheduled hydration (not based on thirst)
- Water accessible (bedside, chair-side)
- Regular monitoring
- Check medications with doctor

## Prevention Strategies

### Hydration Habits

**Build routine:**
1. Start day with water (250-500ml)
2. Drink with every meal
3. Carry water bottle everywhere
4. Set reminders if needed
5. Track intake if uncertain

**Make it easier:**
- Keep water visible (out of sight = forgotten)
- Flavor with fruit if plain water boring
- Use marked water bottle (shows progress)
- Create "water stations" at home/work

### Clothing Choices

**Reduce water loss:**
- Light colors (reflect heat)
- Loose fit (air circulation)
- Breathable fabrics
- Hat (reduce head heat)
- Cover skin (reduce evaporation in very dry conditions)

### Activity Timing

**Avoid peak heat:**

```
Daily heat cycle:
06:00-10:00  ████████ Cool - best for activity
10:00-15:00  ░░░░░░░░ HOT - minimize activity
15:00-19:00  ████████ Cooling - resume activity
19:00-06:00  ████████ Cool - normal activity
```

**During activity:**
- Take breaks in shade
- Reduce intensity in heat
- Acclimatize gradually (7-14 days)

---

## Risk Factors

**Increased dehydration risk:**

**Environmental:**
- High temperature (> 30°C)
- Low humidity (< 30%)
- Wind (increases evaporation)
- High altitude
- Sun exposure

**Personal:**
- Age (very young, elderly)
- Diabetes
- Kidney disease
- Heart conditions
- Diarrhea/vomiting
- Fever
- Burns (fluid loss)

**Medications:**
- Diuretics (water pills)
- Laxatives
- Some blood pressure medications
- Antihistamines

**Behavioral:**
- Alcohol consumption
- Inadequate fluid intake
- Excessive exercise
- Heavy clothing in heat

## Myths & Facts

**Myth:** "Drink 8 glasses of water per day"
**Fact:** Needs vary greatly. Use urine color and thirst as guides.

**Myth:** "If you're thirsty, you're already dehydrated"
**Fact:** Thirst is an early warning, not a late one. Mild thirst is normal.

**Myth:** "Clear urine means you're well hydrated"
**Fact:** Very clear urine may mean overhydration (rare but possible). Pale yellow is ideal.

**Myth:** "Coffee/tea dehydrate you"
**Fact:** Mild diuretic effect, but still contribute to hydration overall.

**Myth:** "You can't drink too much water"
**Fact:** Hyponatremia (water intoxication) is possible but rare. Happens with extreme overdrinking.

**Myth:** "Sports drinks are always better than water"
**Fact:** Only better when sweating heavily (> 1 hour activity). Otherwise, water is fine.

## Emergency Situations

### No Clean Water Available

**Priority order:**

1. **Treat available water:**
   - Boil for 1 minute minimum
   - Chemical purification (iodine, chlorine)
   - Filter if possible
   - Use best available method

2. **Find alternative sources:**
   - Rainwater collection
   - Dew collection
   - Plant sources (some species)
   - Underground seeps

3. **Ration wisely:**
   - Don't ration if have 2+ day supply
   - If limited: rest in shade, minimize sweating
   - Drink what you have (body can store it)
   - Don't eat if very limited water (digestion requires water)

### Severe Dehydration, No Medical Help

**Last resort measures:**

1. **Rehydration solution** (critical to make correctly)
2. **Cool the body** (reduce further loss)
3. **Rest completely** (minimize water needs)
4. **Small, frequent sips** (better absorption)
5. **Monitor closely** (be ready for emergency)

**If unconscious:**
- DO NOT force fluids
- Recover position (on side)
- Keep airway clear
- Get help ASAP
