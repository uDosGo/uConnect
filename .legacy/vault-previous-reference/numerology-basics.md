# Numerology Basics

**Category:** Reference  
**Tags:** numerology, numbers, cycles, patterns  
**Difficulty:** Beginner

---

## Overview

Numerology is a system that assigns meaning to numbers and their patterns. While not scientifically validated, it provides a structured framework for temporal pattern recognition that can be integrated into mood factor calculations as one input among many.

---

## Core Numbers

### Life Path Number

Calculated from birth date by reducing to a single digit (or master number).

**Calculation:**

```
Birth Date: March 15, 1990
Month: 3
Day: 1 + 5 = 6
Year: 1 + 9 + 9 + 0 = 19 → 1 + 9 = 10 → 1 + 0 = 1

Total: 3 + 6 + 1 = 10 → 1 + 0 = 1
Life Path Number: 1
```

### Master Numbers

Some systems preserve 11, 22, and 33 as "master numbers" with special significance:

- **11** - Intuition, spiritual insight
- **22** - Master builder, practical idealism
- **33** - Master teacher, compassion

## Number Meanings

| Number | Keywords | Energy Type |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Independence, leadership, initiative | Active |
| 2 | Partnership, balance, diplomacy | Receptive |
| 3 | Creativity, expression, joy | Active |
| 4 | Structure, foundation, discipline | Receptive |
| 5 | Change, freedom, adventure | Active |
| 6 | Harmony, responsibility, nurturing | Receptive |
| 7 | Analysis, introspection, wisdom | Receptive |
| 8 | Achievement, power, abundance | Active |
| 9 | Completion, humanitarianism | Active |

---

## Daily Number

Each day has a numerological value based on the date.

**Calculation:**

```python
def daily_number(date) -> int:
    """Calculate numerological day number."""
    total = date.day + date.month + sum(int(d) for d in str(date.year))
    
    while total > 9 and total not in (11, 22, 33):
        total = sum(int(d) for d in str(total))
    
    return total
```

**Example: January 7, 2026**

```
Day: 7
Month: 1
Year: 2 + 0 + 2 + 6 = 10 → 1 + 0 = 1

Total: 7 + 1 + 1 = 9
Daily Number: 9
```

---

## Number Compatibility

Numbers interact through resonance and contrast.

### Compatibility Matrix

| Your Number | Most Compatible | Neutral | Challenging |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | 1, 3, 5 | 7, 9 | 4, 6 |
| 2 | 2, 4, 6 | 8 | 1, 5 |
| 3 | 1, 3, 5, 9 | 6 | 4, 7 |
| 4 | 2, 4, 8 | 6 | 3, 5 |
| 5 | 1, 3, 5, 7 | 9 | 2, 4 |
| 6 | 2, 6, 9 | 3, 4 | 1, 5 |
| 7 | 5, 7 | 1, 9 | 2, 8 |
| 8 | 4, 8 | 2, 6 | 7, 9 |
| 9 | 3, 6, 9 | 1, 5 | 8 |

### Resonance Factor Calculation

```python
def numerology_resonance(personal_number: int, day_number: int) -> float:
    """
    Calculate resonance between personal number and day number.
    
    Returns: 0.0-1.0 factor
    """
    compatible = {
        1: [1, 3, 5], 2: [2, 4, 6], 3: [1, 3, 5, 9],
        4: [2, 4, 8], 5: [1, 3, 5, 7], 6: [2, 6, 9],
        7: [5, 7], 8: [4, 8], 9: [3, 6, 9]
    }
    challenging = {
        1: [4, 6], 2: [1, 5], 3: [4, 7],
        4: [3, 5], 5: [2, 4], 6: [1, 5],
        7: [2, 8], 8: [7, 9], 9: [8]
    }
    
    if day_number == personal_number:
        return 1.0  # Perfect resonance
    elif day_number in compatible.get(personal_number, []):
        return 0.75  # Compatible
    elif day_number in challenging.get(personal_number, []):
        return 0.35  # Challenging
    else:
        return 0.5  # Neutral
```

## Personal Year Cycle

A 9-year cycle based on current year and birth date.

**Calculation:**

```
Current Year: 2026
Birth Month: 3
Birth Day: 15

Personal Year = 2 + 0 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 5 = 19 → 1 + 9 = 10 → 1
Personal Year: 1 (New beginnings cycle)
```

### Year Themes

| Year | Theme | Energy |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | New beginnings, fresh starts | High initiative |
| 2 | Patience, partnerships | Receptive, slow |
| 3 | Creativity, self-expression | Expansive |
| 4 | Building, hard work | Structured |
| 5 | Change, freedom | Volatile |
| 6 | Home, family, responsibility | Stable |
| 7 | Reflection, inner work | Introspective |
| 8 | Achievement, material success | Powerful |
| 9 | Completion, letting go | Transitional |

---

## Hourly Numbers

Time of day can be reduced to numerological values.

**Hour Reduction:**

```
14:30 → 1 + 4 + 3 + 0 = 8
Hour Number: 8

Or by hour alone:
14:00 → 1 + 4 = 5
Hour Number: 5
```

### Hour Qualities

| Hours | Number | Quality |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 00-01 | 0/1 | Transition, new cycle |
| 02-03 | 2/3 | Dreaming, creativity |
| 04-05 | 4/5 | Pre-dawn, change |
| 06-07 | 6/7 | Awakening, reflection |
| 08-09 | 8/9 | Power, completion |
| 10-11 | 1/2 | Initiative, balance |
| 12-13 | 3/4 | Expression, structure |
| 14-15 | 5/6 | Change, harmony |
| 16-17 | 7/8 | Analysis, achievement |
| 18-19 | 9/1 | Transition, renewal |
| 20-21 | 2/3 | Partnership, creativity |
| 22-23 | 4/5 | Foundation, freedom |

## Mood Factor Integration

Numerology contributes to mood factors as a temporal pattern system:

1. **Daily Number** - Base influence for the day
2. **Personal Resonance** - Compatibility with your life path
3. **Hourly Cycle** - Time-based micro-patterns
4. **Personal Year** - Longer cycle context

### Weight in System

Numerology is weighted lower than empirically-validated factors:

- Celestial factors: 25%
- Temporal factors: 25% (numerology ~ 15% of this)
- Behavioral factors: 30%
- Biological factors: 20%

Numerology provides pattern structure but is not treated as predictive.
